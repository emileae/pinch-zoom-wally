notes: iScroll lib for mobile UI

-to prevent page fromscrolling out of view, set bottom position and maybe also adjust it so that none of the page is hidden

-need to initialize each iscroll with a unique var ID and give each scroll wrapper element a unique ID

-check if .page class is required for iScroll

-check if .scroller class is required for iScroll (I think YES)

-works with iScroll4 and Zepto

-need to fix the app when phone goes to sleep mode... the layout breaks, scrolling stops... maybe simplest is to prevent sleep mode using phonegap

-iSCroll lock direction stops horizontal movement when it detects vertical touch gesture like scrolling up/down

-need to figure out how to add widgets, like 3D rotator and video(try video.js)

-SNAP-TO-ELEMENT works as follows: iScroll subdivides the "scroller" into "quadrants" or "pages" the same size as the wrapper.

-NBNB Need to adjust the #pageScroller width by setting the number of pages * wrapperWidth
